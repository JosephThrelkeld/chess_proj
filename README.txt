chess_proj is a chess project created, maintained, and updated solely by Joseph Threlkeld for hobby reasons.

The main goal of this project is to simulate the game of chess. 
Extra goals are to eventually simulate a web server and client relationship and to use and experiment with different Design Patterns.

Thanks for viewing my project.
